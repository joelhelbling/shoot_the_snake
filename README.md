# Shoot The Snake (As a Panda)

_Because that's what Pandas do._

This is a simple game written in Lua using Love2d, and following the
excellent [Shoot the Enemy](http://sheepolution.com/learn/book/14) tutorial.

I have added some refactorings of my own, but the functionality of the game
is basically the same.
