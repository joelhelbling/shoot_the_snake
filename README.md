# Shoot The Snake (As a Panda)

_Because that's what Pandas do._

This is a simple game written in Lua using Love2d, and following the
excellent [Shoot the Enemy](http://sheepolution.com/learn/book/14) tutorial.

I have added some refactorings of my own, but the functionality of the game
is basically the same.

## Backstory

There's a Panda, and he sees a snake.  Doesn't like snakes, so of course
he brings forth a mighty gat, and pops a cap in that reptile.  But with
every bullet that hits the snake, the snake just gets faster, and faster.

And when, despite Panda's evident skill, a bullet finally veers wide of his
alacritous foe, why, the entire world ends, and resets and...There's a
Panda, and he sees a snake...
